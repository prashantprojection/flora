# 🌿 Help Me Test Flora - AI Plant Care!

**Subject:** Early Invitation to Test "Flora" – My New Plant Care App! 🚀

Hi everyone,

I’m excited to share that my new app, **Flora**, is now ready for early testing! I need your help to try it out and make sure it’s perfect before the public launch.

**What is Flora?**
Flora is an AI-powered guide that helps you identify plants, diagnose diseases, and keep track of watering schedules so your green friends stay alive and thriving.

### **How to Join the Test (It takes 2 minutes!)**

Since this is a "Closed Test" on Google Play, you need to opt-in first:

1.  **Click this link**: [Join Flora Beta on Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/test/com.wingsandwallets.flora/1)
2.  Tap **"Become a Tester"**.
3.  Click the link to **download the app** from the Play Store.

### **What I Need From You**
*   **Install & Open**: Just using the app counts towards my Google requirement!
*   **Add a Plant**: Try snapping a photo or adding one manually.
*   **Give Feedback**: If you spot a bug or have an idea, let me know! Even a quick rating on the store helps.

Thank you so much for supporting this journey! 💚

Cheers,
Prashant (Wings and Wallets)
